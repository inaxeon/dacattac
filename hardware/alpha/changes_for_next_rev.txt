SMT soldering rig holes wrong size
Silkscreen - normalise line thickness
PCB update for Q4
Make sure values are on silkscreen
C10 SS ref missing
Add LED(s)
Logo and device description
XSMT from 8V may be wrong
Need holes under inductors
C49 a bit close to L14
Single inductor footprints may have wrong pinout
2DIR pin on 16T245 is wrong
DIR on 74LVC1T45 is also wrong
Larger 16T245 ?
Series termination on DAC clocks before and after buffer
DAC I2C addr clashing with HackRF
R27 connected to wrong place on output
On-board TCXO
	- NOTE: MAKE SURE THE TCXO DOESN'T BLOW THE CPLD ON REGULAR BUILDS OR VICE VERSA!
Add power input
	- With ORing chip
Allow regulators to be bypassed
Try swap op-amps for LMH6714MF/NOPB
Caps on input from HackRF?

To check before next PCB is cut:
2N7002 on sync mod
+/- 5v from regulators?

Update BOM:
Changed so far:
	R43, R38, R41
